## Introduction

**Employee CRUD Application** is a simple .NET Core console application that demonstrates basic in-memory Create, Read, and Delete (CRUD) operations for managing employee data. This application allows you to add, display, and delete employees from a list, using an object-oriented design and modular architecture to ensure clean and maintainable code.

## Features
- Add new employees with their ID, full name, and birth date.
- Display a list of all employees.
- Delete employees by their ID.
- In-memory storage, meaning data is not saved after the application exits.

## Folder Structure
The project follows a modular structure, separating responsibilities for clarity and maintainability:

```
EmployeeCrudApp/
â”œâ”€â”€ Interfaces/            # Contains interface definitions
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ IEmployeeOperations.cs
â”œâ”€â”€ Models/                # Contains data models
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Employee.cs
â”œâ”€â”€ Services/              # Contains service classes with business logic
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ EmployeeOperations.cs
â””â”€â”€ Program.cs             # Entry point of the application
```

## Requirements
